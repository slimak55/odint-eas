# The Odin Project

## Project Etch-a-Sketch

This is my take on the project Etch-a-Sketch from The Odin Project. This project was a bit of challenge because I am still new to javascript. The creation of the grid, was fairly easy, however the color changing was a bit harder. I could not figure out how to change the color, because my listener was not working. I searched and found many things but not the solution. So I cheated a bit, because I am not completely following the curriculum to the dot (Windows user), and I look at the code of different person and it help me a not, because I understood the problem and solve it. 

So here we have a lame but functional Etch-a-Sketch.
